It is expected that\n              vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP\n              800-131A.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with the\n              <xref to=\"mod-wlanclient\" />. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated\n              protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this\n              PP allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP\n              800-131A.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing\n              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash\n              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for\n              example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys). <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The TSF hashing functions can\n              be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this\n              mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e.\n              the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is\n              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. The\n              TSF may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not\n              required. </note>\n  <aactivity>\n    <TSS> The evaluator shall check that the association of the hash function with other\n                TSF cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature verification\n                function) is documented in the TSS.

The ST author will select the function used, and include the\n              specific underlying cryptographic primitives used in the requirement or in the TSS.\n              While any of the identified hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) are\n              allowed for Hash_DRBG or HMAC_DRBG, only AES-based implementations for CTR_DRBG are\n              allowed. <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The ST author must also ensure that any underlying\n              functions are included in the baseline requirements for the TOE. <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n              Health testing of the DRBGs is performed in conjunction with the self-tests required\n              in FPT_TST_EXT.1.1. <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> For the selection in FCS_RBG_EXT.1.2, the ST\n              author selects the appropriate number of bits of entropy that corresponds to the\n              greatest security strength of the algorithms included in the ST. Security strength is\n              defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A. For example, if the implementation\n              includes 2048-bit RSA (security strength of 112 bits), AES 128 (security strength 128\n              bits), and HMAC-SHA-256 (security strength 256 bits), then the ST author would select\n              256 bits. <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The ST author may select either software or hardware\n              noise sources. A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot\n              be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a\n              hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical\n              process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of\n              an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse\n              traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so\n              the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as\n              various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to\n              the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that\n              contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the\n              oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate\n              that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency. </note>\n  <aactivity>\n    <htm:div class=\"eacategory\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Entropy Documentation</htm:div>\n    <htm:div class=\"ea\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\t\t  Documentation shall be produced and the evaluator shall perform the\n\t\t  activities in accordance with <xref to=\"entropy\" />, the \"Clarification to the\n\t\t  Entropy Documentation and Assessment\".\n\t\t</htm:div>\n    <htm:div class=\"eacategory\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">API Documentation</htm:div>\n    <htm:div class=\"ea\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\t\t  The evaluator shall verify\n\t\t  that the API documentation provided according to <xref to=\"adv\" />, includes the\n\t\t  security functions described in FCS_RBG_EXT.1.3.\n\t\t</htm:div>\n    <TSS>There are no TSS evaluation activities for this component.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /></TSS>\n    <Guidance> The evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains\n                appropriate instructions for configuring the RNG functionality.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /></Guidance>\n    <Tests>\n      <htm:b xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Evaluation Activity Note:</htm:b> The following tests require the developer to\n                provide access to a test platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are\n                typically not found on factory products. <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The evaluator shall\n                perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation.

The point\n\t\t\t\t\tof the phrase “does not contain any sensitive data” is to ensure that the overwritten data is\n\t\t\t\t\tcarefully selected, and not taken from a general pool that might contain current or residual data\n\t\t\t\t\tthat itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /></note>\n  <aactivity>\n    <TSS>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterial (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case.

The evaluator shall check that the AGD provides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tidentifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevice for some particular time to maximize the probability that garbage collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas occurred).<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible that the storage may implement wear-leveling and garbage collection.

As basic functionality, the VMM must support a security policy that mandates \n                        no information transfer between VMs.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                        The VMM must support the necessary mechanisms to isolate the resources of all \n                        VMs. The VMM partitions a platform's physical resources for use by the \n                        supported virtual environments. Depending on customer requirements, a VM may need a completely \n                        isolated environment with exclusive access to system resources or share some of its resources with other \n                        VMs. It must be possible to enforce a security policy that prohibits the transfer of data \n                        between VMs through shared devices.

To achieve system integrity, the \n                        integrity of each VMM component must be established and maintained. This objective concerns \n                        only the integrity of the VS—not the integrity of software running inside of Guest \n                        VMs or of the physical platform. The overall objective is to ensure the integrity of \n                        critical components of a VS.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                        Initial integrity of a VS can be established through mechanisms such as a digitally signed installation or \n                        update package, or through integrity measurements made at launch. Integrity is maintained in a running system \n                        by careful protection of the VMM from untrusted users and software. For example, it must not\n                        be possible for software running within a Guest VM to exploit a vulnerability in a device or\n                        hypercall interface and gain control of the VMM. The vendor must release patches for \n                        vulnerabilities as soon as practicable after discovery.\n                    </description>"

These \n                        VMM management functions are privileged, with the security of the entire system relying on \n                        their proper use. The VMM management functions can be classified into different categories \n                        and the policy for their use and the impact to security may vary accordingly.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                        The management functions are distributed throughout the VMM (within the \n                        VMM and Service VMs). The VMM must support the necessary \n                        mechanisms to enable the control of all management functions according to the system security policy. When a \n                        management function is distributed among multiple Service VMs, the VMs \n                        must be protected using the security mechanisms of the Hypervisor and any Service VMs \n                        involved to ensure that the intent of the system security policy is not compromised. Additionally, since \n                        hypercalls permit Guest VMs to invoke the Hypervisor, and often allow the passing of data \n                        to the Hypervisor, it is important that the hypercall interface is well-guarded and that all parameters be \n                        validated.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The VMM maintains configuration data for every \n                        VM on the system. This configuration data, whether of Service or Guest VMs,\n                        must be protected. The mechanisms used to establish, modify and verify configuration data are part of the VS \n                        management functions and must be protected as such. The proper internal configuration of Service \n                        VMs that provide critical security functions can also greatly impact VS security. These \n                        configurations must also be protected. Internal configuration of Guest VMs should not \n                        impact overall VS security. The overall goal is to ensure that the VMM, including the \n                        environments internal to Service VMs, is properly configured and that all Guest \n                        VM configurations are maintained consistent with the system security policy throughout \n                        their lifecycle.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> Virtualization Systems are often managed remotely. For \n                        example, an administrator can remotely update virtualization software, start and shut down \n                        VMs, and manage virtualized network connections. If a console is required, it could be \n                        run on a separate machine or it could itself run in a VM. When performing remote management, \n                        an administrator must communicate with a privileged management agent over a network. Communications with the \n                        management infrastructure must be protected from Guest VMs and operational networks.\n                    </description>"
