Security strength is\n              defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A.

A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot\n              be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a\n              hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical\n              process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of\n              an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse\n              traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so\n              the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as\n              various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to\n              the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that\n              contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the\n              oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate\n              that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency. </note>\n    <aactivity>\n      <htm:div class=\"eacategory\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Entropy Documentation</htm:div>\n      <htm:div class=\"ea\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\t\t  Documentation shall be produced and the evaluator shall perform the\n\t\t  activities in accordance with <xref to=\"entropy\" />, the \"Clarification to the\n\t\t  Entropy Documentation and Assessment\".\n\t\t</htm:div>\n      <htm:div class=\"eacategory\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">API Documentation</htm:div>\n      <htm:div class=\"ea\" xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\t\t  The evaluator shall verify\n\t\t  that the API documentation provided according to <xref to=\"adv\" />, includes the\n\t\t  security functions described in FCS_RBG_EXT.1.3.\n\t\t</htm:div>\n      <TSS>There are no TSS evaluation activities for this component.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /></TSS>\n      <Guidance> The evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains\n                appropriate instructions for configuring the RNG functionality.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /></Guidance>\n      <Tests>\n        <htm:b xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Evaluation Activity Note:</htm:b> The following tests require the developer to\n                provide access to a test platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are\n                typically not found on factory products. <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The evaluator shall\n                perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation.

The former is referred to as the NV image, and the latter is the\n\t\t\t\tupdate image. While the update image is typically newer than the NV image, this is not a requirement.\n\t\t\t\tThere are legitimate cases where the system owner may want to rollback a component to an older version\n\t\t\t\t(e.g., when the component manufacturer releases a faulty update, or when the system relies on an \n\t\t\t\tundocumented feature no longer present in the update). Likewise, the owner may want to update with the\n\t\t\t\tsame version as the NV image to recover from faulty storage.<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                            All discrete software components (e.g., applications, drivers, kernel, firmware) of the TSF, should be \n\t\t\t\tdigitally signed by the corresponding manufacturer and subsequently verified by the mechanism\n\t\t\t\tperforming the update. Since it is recognized that components may be signed by different manufacturers,\n\t\t\t\tit is essential that the update process verify that both the update and NV images were produced by the \n\t\t\t\tsame manufacturer (e.g., by comparing public keys) or signed by legitimate signing keys (e.g.,\n\t\t\t\tsuccessful verification of certificates when using X.509 certificates).<h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                            The Digital Signature option is the preferred mechanism for authenticating updates.

xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\nThe interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, \nthe most likely of which is an application programming interface to an OS kernel. \nThere may be various levels of abstraction visible.\nFor instance, in a given implementation that overwrites a key stored in non-volatile memory, \nthe application may have access to the file system details and \nmay be able to logically address specific memory locations.\nIn another implementation, that instructs the underlying platform to destroy the \nrepresentation of a key stored in non-volatile memory, \nthe application may simply have a handle to a resource and \ncan only ask the platform to delete the resource, as may be the case with a platforms secure key store.\nThe latter implementation should only be used for the most restricted access.\nThe level of detail to which the TOE has access will be reflected in the TSS section of the ST.\n\t      </h:p>\n      <h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\nSeveral selections allow assignment of a 'value that does not contain any CSP.'\nThis means that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from a source that \nmay contain key material or reveal information about key material, \nand not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. \nThe point of the phrase 'does not contain any CSP' is to ensure that the overwritten \ndata is carefully selected, and not taken from a general 'pool' that might contain current or \nresidual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.\n\t      </h:p>\n      <h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">      \nFor the selection <xref to=\"s-kek-kill\" />,\na key can be considered destroyed by destroying the key that protects the key.\nIf a key is wrapped or encrypted it is not necessary to \"overwrite\" that key,\noverwriting the key that is used to wrap or encrypt the key used to encrypt/decrypt data,\nusing the appropriate method for the memory type involved, will suffice.\nFor example, if a product uses a KEK to encrypt a Data Encryption Key\n(DEK), destroying the KEK using one of the methods in FCS_CKM_EXT.4 is sufficient, \nsince the DEK would no longer be usable (of course, presumes the DEK is still encrypted \nand the KEK cannot be recovered or re-derived.).\n\t      </h:p>\n    </note>\n

To reduce this risk, the operating system and file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.\n\t      </h:p>\n        <h:p xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\nThe drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end-of-lifed before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.\n\t      </h:p>\n      </Guidance>\n      <Tests>\n        <testlist>\n          <test>Applied to each key held as in volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile memory).

Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated\n              protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this\n              PP allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP\n              800-131A.<htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing\n              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash\n              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for\n              example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys). <htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /><htm:br xmlns:htm=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /> The TSF hashing functions can\n              be implemented in one of two modes.

The second mode is\n              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length.

A distinct\n              network interface is one or more physical connections that share a common\n              logical path into the TOE. For example, the TOE might have a small form-factor\n              pluggable (SFP) port supporting SFP modules that expose a number of physical\n              network ports, but since a common driver is used for all external ports they can\n              be treated as a single distinct network interface.\n              <h:br xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n              Note that there could be a separate ruleset for each interface or alternately a\n              shared ruleset that somehow associates rules with specific interfaces.\n            </note>\n    <aactivity level=\"element\">\n      <TSS>The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes a packet filtering policy that can use the following fields\n                for each identified protocol, and that the RFCs identified for each protocol are supported: <h:ul xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><h:li>IPv4 (RFC 791)</h:li><h:ul><h:li>source address</h:li><h:li>destination address</h:li><h:li>protocol</h:li></h:ul><h:li>IPv6 (RFC 8200)</h:li><h:ul><h:li>source address</h:li><h:li>destination address</h:li><h:li>next header (protocol)</h:li></h:ul><h:li>TCP (RFC 793)</h:li><h:ul><h:li>source port</h:li><h:li>destination port</h:li></h:ul><h:li>UDP (RFC 768)</h:li><h:ul><h:li>source port</h:li><h:li>destination port</h:li></h:ul></h:ul>\n                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how conformance with the identified RFCs has been\n                determined by the TOE developer (e.g., third party interoperability testing, protocol compliance testing).\n                <h:br xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                The evaluator shall verify that each rule can identify the following actions: permit, discard, and log.\n                <h:br xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" />\n                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS identifies all interface types subject to the packet filtering policy\n                and explains how rules are associated with distinct network interfaces.

Because the specific authentication method (TLS in\n            this case) is opaque to the TOE, there are no requirements with respect to RFC 5126 in this PP-Module.\n            However, the base RADIUS protocol (2865) has an update (3579) that will need to be addressed in the\n            implementation and evaluation activities.

Depending on customer requirements, a VM may need a completely \n                        isolated environment with exclusive access to system resources or share some of its resources with other \n                        VMs. It must be possible to enforce a security policy that prohibits the transfer of data \n                        between VMs through shared devices.

The proper internal configuration of Service \n                        VMs that provide critical security functions can also greatly impact VS security. These \n                        configurations must also be protected. Internal configuration of Guest VMs should not \n                        impact overall VS security.

If a console is required, it could be \n                        run on a separate machine or it could itself run in a VM. When performing remote management, \n                        an administrator must communicate with a privileged management agent over a network.
